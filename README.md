## ðŸš€ Publishing

The website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and publish using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Pour generate the website: 
- Locally: run `quarto render` in the right folder
- Online: see `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

Now that the website is set-up, everything should work fine out of the box. If you have any struggle to build the website locally, try to delete the `_site` and `.quarto` folders.
